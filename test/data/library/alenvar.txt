Of Alenvar

Of all Elven legends, the Miloren Cycle is certainly the most fascinating. It not only plays
a pivotal role in the history of the Elves, but is also remembered in such great detail. If you
ever happen to meet an Elvish storyteller, you will find that he could speak for hours about
Alenvars first journey alone. You could listen for days and hear no more than a part of the
Cycle.

After spending most of my life with the elves of Forenor, I feel that I should pass on some of
my knowledge to those of my people who haven't had the good fortune to be welcome among
the Fair Folk. This is the story of Alenvar I wish to tell, and although we will meet other key
figures of the Miloran Cycle as they cross his path, they must remain in the background. The
same is true for many of Alenvars deeds, as I do not wish to simply recount the numerous
battles with his foes, but the inner struggles that determined his, and in the end his peoples,
fate.

When after the long odyssey Menagond of the Wood-elves and the wise and beautiful
Telimae found together, they had a son and they named him Alenvar. He grew up to become
a skilled hunter and soon surpassed his father in strength and might, and of his mother he
learned much of the great lore of old.

His journeys took him far to the north and long he wandered unseen in the lands of Men,
where he became aware of preparations as of war. And being uneased and roused by these
tidings, he went to Elgilad, the Elvish chief city at the river Elenstroem, and spoke before
the Council. His account bore no great surprise however, for Men were already entering the
realm of Elves in large numbers, although most of them were simple folk that kept away from
Elvish settlements.
‘Ever since Men first crossed the mountains, we have given way to them', Alenvar said.
‘But now we have to stand and fight ere we are washed into the sea!'
There the Wise learned of the fire that was in him and Marglir Evenstar, First of all Great
said: ‘More war has been waged by those of Elven lineage than most of us know, and no good
came of it. And I sense a bad end coming upon you, if you do not rein your hatred.'
But the Wise also knew how great a warrior Alenvar was, and they feared that he would
not listen to reason, but rather go and fight the battle on his own. To prevent him from such
foolishness, they chose to give him an occupation to his liking in the hope that the task at
hand would calm his restless spirit. He received command over a score of rangers and was
sent north to watch the borders and drive away any trespasser. But unforseeable are the ways
of fate, and on this errand he was, when the shadow befell him and he became estranged to
his folk and its customs.

They had made camp in the fair country around the Foroduin, the river marking the
northern border, where still many Elves dwelled; and from there, alone or in pairs they went
about their business. It was so that Alenvar met Andomiel and, although he did not know
her, like a fair summer day she seemed to him as she walked among the trees, and his heart
was filled with delight.

But even before he could step onto the path to greet her, he became aware of a faint
sound as of swift and light footsteps, and from the brush came a horde of filthy men, their
eyes glittering with lust as they approached their prey. They wore ragged furs and carried
long daggers, but some of them had bows also and their bare feet made hardly any noise on
the soft ground.

Andomiel froze as she saw her doom ahead, but out of the trees came Alenvar and with
a mighty stroke of his sword, he beheaded the nearest foe. Then the remaining villains came
upon him. Yet, with a few hews, he drove them apart, and those still on their feet turned
and fled into the forest.

But perilous are Men even in their defeat, and just as Andomiel turned to meet Alenvar,
full of strange and wondrous feelings, an arrow came flying from under the trees. Though it
was badly aimed and only pierced her shoulder, she fell where she stood, for an icy poison
was entering her body, and she died in Alenvar‘s arms. But at the moment of her doom she
gazed into his eyes and so deep her love for him was, that her soul went not beyond, but
straight to her heart's desire. And so eyes met eyes, and souls met souls, and deep within
Alenvar, a part of her lived forth.

His companions, stirred by the din of battle, found him kneeling besides Andomiel, who
even in death was fair to look at; and Isgil, who was friend with Alenvar, recognised her and
cried: ‘Unfortunate Andomiel! Your curse is broken, but only short was your luck.'
Now they were bewildered and curious and they began to question Alenvar and there they
became aware of the change that had befallen him. For he stared ahead with lifeless eyes
and would not answer, and his spirit remained closed to them. So they took them both back
to the camp and laid Alenvar to rest in his tent. Andomiel they buried under a lonely tree
in the centre of the clearing. Then they held counsel, for they knew no advice and none of
them had learned how to tend wounds of heart or mind. But even greater was their surprise
and confusion, when they returned to the tent and found Alenvar gone, with no trace or
sign showing them the path he had taken, and it was a long time, ere they heard of him again.

Long wandered Alenvar in darkness. He ate when he felt hungry and slept when he was
tired, but his mind was clouded with pain and anger and a steadily increasing hatred of
Men and their evil doings. Although he went where chance might take him in this pathless
country, guided only by Andomiel‘s spirit, he travelled mostly southwards and was not
far from Elgilad when he finally reached the Elenstroem. And there, the merry tinkling of
the water as it ran with much haste along its stony bed, chased his dark thoughts away,
and for the first time since Andomiels death did he come to senses. And there at the waterside,
against all Elvish traditions, he swore an oath to free his people from the menace of Men.

With this intent he came to the High City and people looked at him with wonder, for a
fire was gleaming in his eyes, and although his clothes were ragged and hung in pieces from his
dirty skin, his steps were firm and steady, and like a king he walked the streets, not like the
beggar he seemed to be. Straight to the Council he went and great was the surprise among
the Wise. It was not his appearance which drew their attention, for they could see deeper,
but the shadow in his heart and the fierceness in his eyes.
‘We had news that Alenvar, son of Menagond, is lost', Marglir spoke, ‘and alas! now that
I see you before me, I must confess tis true indeed.'
But Alenvar replied ‘Then your need has to be truly great, if the lost return to save you',
and there they fell silent while he spoke long of battle and war. Of the human nature he told
them, for much he had learned about their ways and thoughts on his journeys through their
realms. And of the errors of the Wise whenever dealing with Men, he accused them. Men
would never renounce a thing they could easily take, and to them, the Elvish land seemed
such a thing. ‘And once their soldiers come to plunder and pillage, many of our folk will
perish on the battlefield and even more will be slain in their homes or taken to slavery. But
bring the war to them and they might realize that we are not an easy prey at all!' Thus spoke
Alenvar.

There Marglir said: ‘Can't you see that violence is not the way to deal with Men? Or did
your resistance prevent Andomiel from her fate?' and so Alenvar learned how great a loss he
really suffered and this only added to his obsession. And Marglir saw that he himself had
lead up to Alenvars fall, and he was sad and full of compassion; and he finally said: ‘To send
our folk to war lies beyond the Councils authority, but if this is your wish, you may bring
forth your request and lead those willing to follow you against Men.' But deep within his
heart he hoped that others would see the errors in Alenvars way and bring him back to senses.
But Marglir did not know how much Telimae had taught her son, and when Alenvar spoke
before his people, he recounted many tales of old, where Elves had striven for peace, but the
chieftains of Men never kept their oaths for long, and peacefulness always turned out disadvantageous.
Andomiels spirit gave him the strength to reach into the hearts of those who
listened to his words and so many amongst the crowd were willing to accompany him. But
some said: ‘Who are you, to speak against the Council?' and there Isgil, who happened to
be in Elgilad at that time, stood up and told of Alenvars great deeds in the northern mark,
and so the remaining doubts were cast aside and all who were skilled in the use of weapons
followed Alenvar out of their free will; and after that, Isgil was made second in command.
But those who could not follow Alenvar into battle spread the news of his plans. And so,
many more came to his aid and when he left he led a host of 1000 fighters, armed with bows
and spears. But some carried swords of steel and were clad in dwarvish mail, and those were
led by Isgil.

On secret and hidden paths they came into the north and no message of their intention
came to human ears. Now Elvish scouts told Alenvar of many armed Men gathering near
Farandale, a human city not far from Aerengist, where the Foroduin was calm and shallow
and a ford crossed the river. And during a dark and moonless night Alenvar led his men
across the river and with the first light of dawn they came unseen to Farandale and there
more warriors where encamped than Elves were following Alenvar; but surprise was on his
side and none of those Men ever left the battlefield again, and only few Elves fell. And when
the people of Farandale saw what happened, they fled in terror and Alenvar laid fire to their
homes. There Isgil said: ‘Is it not enough that we slay their kindred and put fear into their
hearts? You are the man no longer that won kind Andomiels love.' But Alenvar in his anger
swore at him and after that their friendship grew cold.

Soon the chieftains of Men learned of the Elvish battalion and the defeat of their army
at Farandale and they were more watchful in their own lands. But Alenvar was familiar with
the country from his previous wanderings and little news of his movements reached the warlords.
For now, they had to give him free hand and many more settlements shared their fate
with Farandale. There was little fighting though, since only few could withstand the sight of
Alenvar and his fellow Elves approaching, with stern faces and in absolute silence. But what
first appeared to be easily won victories turned out perilous for Alenvar.

By driving the people away instead of killing them, and by laying waste to their homes,
so they had nothing to return to, many refugees went further north, where it was easy for
the warlords to gather willing soldiers for another, even larger army. Now Isgil, fearing that
Alenvar was no longer guided by the aim to aid his people, but had given way to his own,
dark obsession, made a final approach to soothe his friend: ‘Have you not fulfilled your oath'
he asked. ‘If there are Men left that have not learned to respect our kind, you will never teach
them. Retreat now and the lesson will be well remembered, but let them defeat you and all
your efforts will come to nothing.' But in his pride, and because his hatred of everything
concerning Men was now unbound, Alenvar despised the warning and so Marglirs prediction
began to fulfill itself. For Isgil, driven by some strange, inner voice, began to speak in secrecy
against his former friend, and many were willing to listen, and they watched Alenvars mood
with disquiet and no longer trusted into his leadership. So far, they had suffered few losses
and caused much damage, but every new day put them into greater danger and most of them
had already enough of their destructive business and of the harsh and desolate land.

Then accounts of another army of Men marching southwards reached them, and they sat
together to make plans. Isgil and many of his secret followers shared the opinion that the
warlords were not interested in battle if not confronted and that it would be best to retreat
over the Foroduin. Alenvar however was not so faithful. He knew the hearts of Men best,
and to him it was obvious that they would seek vengeance and such he told them, and also
where the best location for an ambush was in this country. But, already spoilt by Isgil, weary
of further battles and anticipating the return, most Elves overheard the truth in Alenvars
words and few took his doubts serious. Instead they made his well known temper responsible
for the intention to launch another attack and in the end, Alenvar had to give in to them.
So they returned, save a few trusted kinsmen that were left behind by Alenvar to watch
the warlords' doings. There was much joy among the Elves as they crossed the Foroduin
and came into their own country again, and there they rested and all dark thoughts and
sorrow fell from them. Only Alenvar found no peace, for he feared that Men would not be
so merciful once they brought the war to the Elvish realm. When finally messengers arrived,
with news of the nearing enemy, he was fully consumed by his obsessions, and he could not
bear the thought of Men setting their foot on Elvish land. And when his fellows, alarmed by
the unexpected development, and still remembering Alenvars words about the human thirst
for revenge, asked him what to do, he decided against all common sense to hold the ford of
Aerengist against the foe. He and his fighters would guard the entrance to the ford, but Isgil
should remain hidden to attack the enemy from behind. This time, Isgil did not argue, for
he was eyed with suspicion now, but deep inside his heart he was worried and fear grew in
him. So they parted, and while Isgil vanished into the nearby hills, Alenvar took position at
the riverbank to await the assault.

It came after dawn, when mist that had risen from the Foroduin still hovered over the
valley and clouded the opponents' sight. But Isgil, out of his elevated position, could see how
numerous the enemy was: row upon row filled the valley from one end to the other, and there
all courage left him and, sure death in his eyes, he took his men and fled and it was much later
ere he found forgiveness. Only one of his warriors, Thalin by name, withstood Isgils order
and went to his peoples aid, and a few of his kindred went with him. When they came near
the ford, the battle was already against Alenvar, and only with much effort and under great
losses he could hold back the enemy. Now they made haste and fought their way to Alenvars
banner, and little harm they suffered for their armour was strong and of high craftsmanship.
So they met in the midst of battle, and as Thalin told of Isgils treachery, sadness came upon
Alenvar and the darkness fell of him at last and he saw that the battle was lost. There he
ordered retreat, but he and Thalin and those with him remained to hold back the hordes of
Men. Suddenly the first sunbeams broke through the mist, making water and dewdrops in
the grass gleam in all the rainow's colors, and within the circle of light stood Alenvar with his
companions, and such an impressive sight they were, that the attack came to a halt. So many
of the Elves would escape across the river and into the forest before the humans recovered
from their frozen awe and threw themselves at the remaining defenders. And in the end, only
Alenvar stood, and many more he slew before his death and when the warlords finally came
into the realm of Elves, many of their fighters lay dead at the ford of Aerengist and only little
mischief they caused before they were scattered and driven back.

So ended the greatest of Elvish warriors of this age, but from then on many Elves learned
the art of warfare and although they never became a warlike folk, they could defend themselves
much better against any assaults and this they owe to Alenvar.
